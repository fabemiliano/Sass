# Sass Guide Sheet

In this repository, there is a html file which I have styled with Sass. It is quite basic, however my
goal was to describe some features the pre processor can perform. 

I have been learning a lot about css and UI and Sass has proved to be an excelent lib to make the design
process much easier and more fun.

Some of the tools covered by this guide:

- Nesting;
- Variables;
- Inheritance;
- Imports;
- Mixin;
- Functions;
- For Loop;
- Each Loop;
- If Statements;

On the long run, as I improve my skills, I will update this guide.

### Runing Localy

Sass is not ran by the browser. In order to make it readable it is necessary to tranpile it to css.
To do so, the easiest way is to add a VS Code extention called [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass).
